## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Answer:No, As can be seen in the graph, family companies do not participate more in volunteer activities. The frequency of family companies participating in volunteer activities is almost the same as that of companies except startups, and startups are the type of company that participates most frequently.

The graph illustrates the percentage of engaged employees in volunteering programs across different company types. For "75% and above" engagement, family companies have a low percentage, while startups show the highest engagement. In the "50-74%" range, family companies have moderate engagement. For "25-49%", family companies again show moderate engagement, comparable to others. In the "less than 25%" category, family companies have one of the lowest engagements. The data suggests that employees in family companies are not more engaged in volunteering programs compared to startups or self-employed individuals.
