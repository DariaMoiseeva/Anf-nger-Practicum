There might be differences in the engagement of employees in corporate volunteering activities between the 
service industry and the manufacturing industry. The service industry typically has a younger and more 
diverse workforce, which might result in higher employee engagement in volunteering. 
However, the specific differences depend on the culture and values of individual companies. 
Manufacturing companies can also have active CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) programs, 
but the level of employee participation may vary based on company culture and nature. 
Therefore, specific data analysis is needed to understand the differences in employee engagement between these two industries.
